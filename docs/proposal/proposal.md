## SECTION B

### Introduction

Datative is a tool which allows users to generate insightful dashboards and reports from their data. The tool will allow the user full customisation of their dashboards, including the data included in each component. It will also offer powerful analytics on the data depending on the userâ€™s needs.

### Outline

The user can upload a file containing their data. There are a number of file types which can be uploaded such as Excel, CSV and TXT files. The data will then be cleaned and stored in the database. The user can choose what algorithm they want to perform on the data and which part of their data the algorithm will target. The results of the algorithm are displayed in a component, which the user can drag anywhere on their dashboard canvas. Once the user is happy with their dashboard layout, they can export a PDF report of their dashboard.

### Background

The idea for this application came from the lack of simplistic dashboarding and reporting tools. Rather than having to connect a data source, the user can simply upload their data to the application to be processed. Also, as it is a web application, it is easily accessible by anyone with internet access.

### Achievements
This tool targets users who want to get the most from their data without paying expensive licencing fees for large, enterprise-grade applications. It will offer a number of different functions, such as:

1. Handle authorisation of users through a login feature.
2. Accept data in multiple file formats.
3. A wide range of algorithms so users can get the best insights from their data.
4. Fully customisable dashboards and reports.
5. Data and reports can be stored for future use.
6. Dashboards can be exported as reports in PDF format.
 


### Justification

* This is a universal tool which will cover multiple sectors in business.
* It will also cater to individual users in areas such as sports, health or education.
* It will have a large range of algorithms to suit users needs.
* It can be used to quickly generate reports and dashboards without having to use a professional analysis application designer.
* Data can be used in many forms allowing the user to leverage all their data.
